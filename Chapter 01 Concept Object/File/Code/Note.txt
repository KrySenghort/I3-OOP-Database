==> Object are all identifiable entity models, concrete or abstract, handled by the software application.

==> Structure is the sequence of data type that we can assign value in it. But for class we cannot assign the value to it.

==> struct person{
	int id;
	string name;  # name is the internal state or data member. }
==> struct p1 = {1,'Savin'}

==> struct p2 = {2,'Piseth'}  # the p1 and p2 are objects.
id and name are internal state of p. where p is object.
==> printf('%d',p1.id)
==> print('%s',p1.name)

==> printf('%d',p2.id)
==> print('%s',p2.name)
# when no internal state, so it is not object.

< primary datatype >
< class type >

==> member functions 
==> Behavior : is the action capacities of object given by functions or sub-program
